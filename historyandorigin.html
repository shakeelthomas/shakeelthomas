    <!--Brief information about the website, its purpose and passion for steelpans-->
	
                <p><h3>Although steel drums (steel pans) were invented in the Caribbean island of Trinidad and Tobago sometime around the Second World War, they had been evolving since the 1800's when the inhabitants were celebrating Carnival (a street parade). This festivity was brought to the island by the French.

After the slaves were freed in 1834, they joined in the festivities using their drums. They replaced their drums with tuned bamboo sticks called Tamboo Bamboo. ("Tamboo" is derived from the French name for drums-Tambour). The larger sticks were stomped on the ground,and the smaller ones were struck together. This is what these instruments look like:</h3></br></p>

        <li><h4>The Low Tenor, which has a pitch range from C4 to E6 has notes that are arranged in the same order as the high tenor. The function of this steel pan is the same as that of the high tenor and it is also used by pan soloists.</h4> </br>

        <li><h4>The bass pans are known for their repetitive, rhythmic patterns. They are also known to produce melodies or counter melodies in competition arrangements.

They are generally painted, but on rare occasions you may see them chrome plated. The pans are full length and set up in a circle or inverted U shape. There are many note variations for each type of bass..</h4></br></br>
